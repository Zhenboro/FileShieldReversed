## About
This project aims to reverse the database used by "Wor FileShield". This @Worcome-Studios program is dedicated to protecting files.
We take the universal Cryptographic key and decrypt the data base AND unprotect the files :).

For a long time we have been trying to see its source code with various techniques. Months until 4/5/2021 we achieved it together with the OSH chat.

## Legal Troubles
we know that the [license](http://worcomestudios.comule.com/Recursos/AppHelper/AboutApps/About_WorFileShield.html) for the user is clearly stated 
```sh
3. Reverse engineering, decompilation and disassembly
You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE.
  ```
But who can resist when the morbidity of a programmer calls?
